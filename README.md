# cubesat-attitude-simulation
High-fidelity CubeSat attitude determination and control simulator using quaternion dynamics. Implements log-map PD/PID control, reaction wheel saturation and momentum buildup, magnetorquer desaturation, and environmental disturbances (gravity gradient, drag, SRP). MATLAB simulation with 3D visualization.
