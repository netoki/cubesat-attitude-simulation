This project simulates spacecraft attitude dynamics using quaternion-based kinematics in MATLAB. The system propagates orientation over time, logs attitude states, and provides visualization and validation of quaternion behavior, reflecting workflows used in spacecraft GNC analysis.

Features:

- Quaternion attitude propagation
- Discrete-time simulation
- Numerical normalization and stability checks
- Attitude visualization and analysis
- MATLAB-only implementation
- Actuation, disturbance (SRP, gravity gradient, drag), and noise modeling. 


Outputs:

- Quaternion Time History
- Disturbance Torque Time History
- Reaction Wheel Angular Momentum Time History
- Magnetorquer Torque Time History
- Optional Animation
- Option Quaternion Data CSV Export (for more complex visualization)
